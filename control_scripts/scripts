1.modify runAll.sh to use a step of 1 for gliomaso,ver likelihood calculation
2.modify tmcmc_glioma.par to use the custom  


# script 1: copy a file to all directories in 20P:

for d in */; do cp tmcmc_glioma.par "$d"/Inference; done



#script 2: run setup_inference.sh in all directories:
for d in */; do cd "$d"; ./setupInference.sh; cd ..; done


#script 3: setup the inference folder for deeptumor:
Pseudocode:
copy already set up Inference (where gliomaSolver will work)
remove everything from TMPTMP subdirectory
copy new runAll.sh to TMPTMP subdirectory
